Please read the README.md. I want to make apps that could generatively autobuild UI. I just thought of using React + Webcomponents.org, or Streamlit. There is input of max rows available on screen, like maybe max_rows=12. For cols, I just set cols_height=84px. What framework should I use? If using Webcomponents.org, should I use Vue or ReactJS? If so, should I use Nuxt, Next, or Vite? Could you give me few recommendation or suggestion where should I start?
